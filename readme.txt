Many of us know the pain of creating a new product or post and browsing manually through 100+ categories to find the right one.
Minty company decided to make life easier for you with this little, handy plugin.

All you have to do is install it and choose from the settings page (Settings -> Search Post Category) on what kind of posts you'd
like to see the search feature. That simple!
